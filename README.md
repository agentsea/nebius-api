# Nebius API

This repository contains the `.proto` files defining the gRPC API for [nebius.ai](https://nebius.ai). These files describe the structure of requests and responses exchanged between your client application and Nebius services using Protocol Buffers.

## API Endpoints

Nebius gRPC services are accessible at addresses that follow a specific format: `{service-name}.{base-address}`. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Base Address**:
   - Currently, there is only one `{base-address}`: `api.eu-north1.nebius.cloud:443`. Nebius will introduce additional base addresses soon.
1. **Service Name Derivation**:
   - Services with `option (api_service_name)`:
     - Some services explicitly define their name using this annotation (e.g., `option (api_service_name) = "foo.bar"`), this value becomes the `{service-name}` used in the address.
     - For example, requests to `TokenExchangeService` ([iam](nebius/iam/v1/token_exchange_service.proto)) would be sent to: `tokens.iam.api.eu-north1.nebius.cloud:443`.
   - Services without `option (api_service_name)`:
     - For services lacking this annotation, the `{service-name}` is derived from the first level directory within the `.proto` file path.
     - For instance, requests to `DiskService` (declared in [nebius/**compute**/v1/disk_service.proto](nebius/compute/v1/disk_service.proto)) would be directed to `compute.api.eu-north1.nebius.cloud:443`
1. **Special Case**: `OperationService`
   - `nebius.common.v1.OperationService` ([common](nebius/common/v1/operation_service.proto)) is an exception to the naming convention.
   - When fetching the status of an operation returned by another service, use the original service's address.
   - As an example, to fetch the status of an operation created by `DiskService` ([compute](nebius/compute/v1/disk_service.proto)), you would use: `compute.api.eu-north1.nebius.cloud:443`.

## Operations

Most methods that modify data return an `nebius.common.v1.Operation` ([operation.proto](nebius/common/v1/operation.proto)). This message represents both synchronous and asynchronous operations. The only difference is that a synchronous operation is returned in a completed state and won't be updated further.

### Status

An operation is considered complete if the `status` field is set (not null). If `status` is null, the operation is still in progress. Additionally, a completed operation includes a `finished_at` timestamp.

The `status.details` field might contain extra information in the form of a `nebius.common.v1.ServiceError` ([error.proto](nebius/common/v1/error.proto)).

### Parallel Operations

Currently, performing multiple operations on the same resource simultaneously is not supported. Attempting to do so will result in either an error on the second request or the service aborting the first operation and returning a new one.

### Retention

Operations that are still running are never deleted. However, completed operations may be deleted after a certain period. The specific retention policy varies depending on the service.
